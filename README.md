Rock-Paper-Scissors-:

This is a brief instruction on how to play the game “ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS”. When you see the dialog box, you must specify your answer (rock, paper or scissors) and then click “OK” to see the result in your browser's console.log. You will also see what round it is now. You can try your luck 5 times, and at the end you will see the winner of this game: you or the computer.

How this game was built:

    Create a computer selection function based on Math.random() and convert the answer to the value (1,2,3);
    Create a human selection function and be sure to correct the answer (e.g., “RoCk”);
    Create one round of the game, which will provide a single result for the first round and the remaining 4 rounds;
    Create a function to calculate total score for human and computer;
    Create a function to compare the total points of the human and computer after 5 rounds to see who is the winner.
